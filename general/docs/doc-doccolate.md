Doccolate
=========

**Docco** is a literate-programming-style
documentation generator. It produces HTML that displays your comments
alongside your code.

**Doccolate** is a modified version of Docco that can be used on demand both on client and server side.
It supports Coffeescript, Javascript, CSS and Markdown file formats.

You can use it by clicking on the **Doc** button while a source file is opened. 
Then you will immediately see if your source is well documented. Source modifications are reflected on the fly!

Source comments are passed through
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), and code is
passed through [Highlight](http://softwaremaniacs.org/wiki/doku.php/highlight.js:highlight.js) syntax highlighting.
